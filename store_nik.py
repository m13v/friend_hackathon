Today I randomly posted an AI wearable project on Kickstarter 

In a few hours it overachieved the goal by 250% and blew up on twitter

I'm excited to announce that from today, I'm working on FRIEND

It's an open source AI wearable that records, summarizes and gives feedback on your conversations

It costs only $39 and allows anyone to build the apps they want

Here is how it works:

ðŸ“¢ I'm very excited to announce that Toptal has acquired WLNC

Our journey at WLNC has been eventful and tumultuous â€“ as many startups endeavors are. Today, however, we're excited to share that Toptal, the top platform for on-demand talent, has acquired us. This move paves the way for expansive growth in the no-code sector, backed by Toptal's vast resources.

Why Toptal? Their scale and success will enable our growth, making them an ideal partner for realizing our vision. Our customers will transition smoothly to Toptal's platform, ensuring continuous access to trusted services. Our experts will soon have the chance to join Toptal's network.

A huge thank you to our customers, experts, investors, and advisors for their continuous support. Kudos to our dedicated team, including Alex Hudym, Daniel Gorenko, Manal Rayess, Daniel Baise, Caio Kaspary, and everyone else who helped along the journey, for making this possible.

Some team members will join Toptal, while others pursue new paths. If you're hiring, consider our talented team ready for new roles: https://rb.gy/oa20o

What's next: I am excited to start a new company right away! I will be exploring new avenues such as VR/AR, Robots, Longevity, and more. If you are working on something cool or have an interest in any of these industries, reach out to me at kodjima33@gmail.com. You can also discover my thoughts on the future here: https://lnkd.in/eXgprh7B

A few years ago, I embarked on a journey from the middle of nowhere to San Francisco with a dream and a vision. Today, I'm proud to be at the helm of WLNC, a no-code talent marketplace that bridges gaps and creates opportunities for people who can't relocate

Here are three lessons I've learned along the way:
Embrace Diversity: Moving from Russia to San Francisco taught me the value of diverse perspectives. Our platform thrives because we celebrate differences and believe in the power of global collaboration.

Resilience is Key: Building a startup is never a straight path. There have been challenges, but each setback has been a setup for a bigger comeback. To every young entrepreneur out there, remember that persistence pays off.

Community Matters: San Francisco's vibrant tech community has been instrumental in our growth. The support, mentorship, and connections I've found here are unparalleled.

To everyone who's been a part of this journey, thank you. And to those just starting out, remember: every big dream begins with a single step. Keep moving forward!

How to successfully raise funding and grow a startup to $130K MRR in less than a year? Happy to share my learning ðŸ‘‡

My name is Nik and I'm the founder of WLNC, a platform that connects businesses with the best no code developers to build software and applications without a single line of code. 

Having just raised $1M in seed funding, broke through the $130k MRR barrier, formed the biggest no-code marketplace (3k+ no-code developers) â€” I have learned a lot.

Find all of the best tips from my practical experience which can help you grow.



P.S.: If you want to join a fast-growing rocketship, message me.
